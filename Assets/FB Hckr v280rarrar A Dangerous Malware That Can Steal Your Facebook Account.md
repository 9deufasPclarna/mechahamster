According to security experts, FB Hckr v.2.8.0.rar.rar is a Trojan horse that disguises itself as a Facebook password cracker. Once downloaded and executed, it asks the user to enter their Facebook email and password, claiming that it will hack the target account. However, instead of doing that, it sends the user's credentials to a remote server controlled by cybercriminals.
 
The malware can also download and install other malicious programs on the infected device, such as keyloggers, ransomware, spyware, or adware. These programs can monitor the user's online activity, steal their personal data, encrypt their files, or display unwanted ads.
 
The best way to avoid falling victim to FB Hckr v.2.8.0.rar.rar is to never download or open suspicious files from unknown sources. You should also use a reliable antivirus software and update it regularly. If you suspect that your Facebook account has been hacked, you should change your password immediately and enable two-factor authentication.

- FB Hacker Pro.exe
- Facebook Password Sniper.zip

You should avoid downloading or opening any of these files, as they can cause serious damage to your device and privacy. You should also be wary of any websites or links that offer Facebook hacking tools, as they may be phishing scams or malware distributors.
 
The only way to hack a Facebook account is to guess or obtain the password of the target user. This can be done by using social engineering techniques, such as phishing, spoofing, or guessing security questions. However, this is illegal and unethical, and can result in legal consequences or account suspension.
 
Therefore, you should never attempt to hack someone else's Facebook account, or use any tools that claim to do so. You should also protect your own account by using a strong and unique password, and by enabling two-factor authentication and other security features.
